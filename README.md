# 👕 WTWR - What to Wear (Frontend)

This is the **frontend** of the _What to Wear_ (WTWR) project — a weather-based clothing recommendation application. The app allows users to view and share clothing items that match the current weather conditions in their location.

The project is built using **React** and integrates with a custom backend (Express + MongoDB) to manage user accounts and clothing data.
